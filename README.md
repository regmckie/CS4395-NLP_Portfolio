# CS4395-NLP_Portfolio
This is Reg Gonzalez's portfolio for class CS 4395.001 (Natural Language Processing). This portfolio is for the Fall 2022 semester at the University of Texas at Dallas, taught by Karen Mazidi. 


### Assignment 0

The objective of this assignment was to create a GitHub portfolio for this class. We also had to write a summary about the historical & current current apporaches to NLP and a paragraph about our own personal interests in NLP; this was called an "Overview of NLP." You can see my "Overview of NLP" pdf [here.](https://github.com/regmckie/CS4395-NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)


### Assignment 1

The objective of this assignment was to get comfortable programming in Python, using system arguments, creating classes, coding regular expressions, and performing file I/O and pickling. This program takes in an .csv file (titled "data.csv") as an argument, extracts the text from that file, reformats it, and displays the reformatted text onto the screen. There is a class called Person that holds in the text and a .display() function that displays the reformatted text. Finally, there is some pickling involvedâ€”essentially we just write the reformatted text into a .p file and read it in to display the information.

You should be able to just run the code normally; however, I worked/ran it through PyCharm. The .py file should already have the data.csv file as a system argument. 

In terms of the strengths and weakness of Python when it comes to text processing, I think a strength of the language is how easy it is to write. Prior to Python, I mostly had experience with C++ and Java, and comparatively speaking, it's much easier to write code in Python than the other two languages. It feels more intuitive and it's not really bogged down by superfluous syntax. Another strength is that there are a lot of useful methods for text processing that make the job a lot easier (e.g., .upper(), .lower(), .capitalize(), etc.). One weakness I've noticed, however, is that sometimes the program loads in slowly, particularly when you run the program for the first time. 

Last semester (Spring 2022), I took CS 4365 (Artificial Intelligence) and CS4375 (Intro to Machine Learning), both of which used Python in their class. Some of this was a review for me (e.g., lists, dictionaries, creating classes, etc.), but some of this was brand new. For example, while I've worked with regular expressions before in other classes, I never did so in Python. I also learned how to read/write pickle files and get experience with sysarg.
