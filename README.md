### Assignment 0

The objective of this assignment was to create a GitHub portfolio for this class. We also had to write a summary about the historical & current current apporaches to NLP and a paragraph about our own personal interests in NLP; this was called an "Overview of NLP." You can see my "Overview of NLP" pdf [here.](https://github.com/regmckie/CS4395-NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf)
